              <div className="prose max-w-none text-recoai-gray">
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Founded in 2022 by e-commerce veterans Sarah Johnson and Michael Chen, RecoAI was born from a shared frustration: powerful customer analytics and personalization tools were too complex and expensive for most online stores.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Having worked with enterprise retailers, Sarah and Michael saw firsthand how AI-driven insights and recommendations could transform businesses. They also recognized that most solutions required dedicated data teams and six-figure budgetsâ€”putting them out of reach for the vast majority of e-commerce entrepreneurs.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                  RecoAI was created to change that. By combining powerful AI technology with intuitive, no-code interfaces, we've made enterprise-grade analytics and personalization accessible to online stores of all sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, we serve thousands of e-commerce businesses worldwide, helping them understand their customers better and create more personalized shopping experiences that drive growth.
